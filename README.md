Playing board games but can't find your dice? No worries, here is a simple dice roll app on your phone!

Developed an iOS application using SwiftUI that used to play two dice rolling games. On the screen, the user can see two dice and the ROLL button on the bottom middle of the screen. When the user taps the roll button it generates a random number and based on the random number dice is rolled.
